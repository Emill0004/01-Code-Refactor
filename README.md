# Challenge 1, Horiseon Service Page

## Description

This project is a service page for the company Horiseon. The website has three main sections with brief descriptions of the topics: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing, On the righthand side of the page are three more brief sections covering related topics, and at the top of the page are three navigation links to the different main sections.

The most recent version of this project fixes a bug with the first navigation link preventing it from working as intended, adds semantic HTML elements, adds descriptive comments to both the HTML and CSS code to improve legibility, adds a more descriptive title to the webpage, and finally adds alt text to each image in the HTML code.
